## Errors and Bugs - todo
No bugs were indentified. The following errors are outputted in a user-friendly and understanding manner on our webapp. Generally, these errors are returned:
* `error_bad_request`: if the request was ill-formed or one of its fields was ill-formed.
* `error_datasource`: if the given data source wasn't accessible (e.g., the file didn't exist or the NWS API returned an error for a given location).
* `error_internal`: an unexpected system error, that ideally should be logged and returned to the developers to check upon.
* `error_bad_json`: if the request was ill-formed

  * go to `localhost:3232` and utilize API endpoints and parameters detailed in the API section of README.

* cd into frontend and run first `npm install` and then `npm start` or `npm run dev`
* Run `Server.main()` and go to `localhost:3232` and utilize API endpoints and parameters detailed in the API section.

* Run the tests: `npm test` for frontend and `mvn test`
  * run the server before running integration tests
